### **Detailed Explanation of ASP.NET Core Project Template Based on Clean Architecture**

Below is a **step-by-step breakdown** of the key directories and files in the structure for your ASP.NET Core project based on **Clean Architecture**:

---

### **1. Root Folder (`/CleanASPCoreTemplate`)**

This folder contains the overall solution and other configuration files. It’s where you initialize and manage your GitHub repository, solution file, `.gitignore`, and README documentation.

#### Files:

- **CleanASPCoreTemplate.sln**:  
  - This is the **solution file**. It groups all the projects in the solution. When you run `dotnet sln`, it will include all related `.csproj` files into one project solution.

- **.gitignore**:  
  - This file is used to **exclude files and folders** from being tracked by Git. For an ASP.NET Core project, it generally includes the `bin/` and `obj/` folders, as well as configuration files and build outputs that don't need to be versioned.  
  Example `.gitignore`:
  ```
  # Ignore build output directories
  bin/
  obj/

  # Ignore user-specific files
  *.user
  *.userosscache
  *.suo
  *.userprefs

  # Ignore ASP.NET Scaffolding
  ScaffoldingReadMe.txt
  ```

- **README.md**:  
  - This file is where you document your project. It provides an overview of your project, its purpose, setup instructions, and other relevant information.  
  Example content:
  ```markdown
  # CleanASPCoreTemplate
  This project is built using Clean Architecture principles in ASP.NET Core.
  
  ## Getting Started
  To get started, clone this repo and run `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies.
  
  ## Running the Application
  To run the application, use:
  ```bash
  dotnet run
  ```

  ## Project Structure
  The project follows Clean Architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:
  - `WebApi`: The web API layer.
  - `Application`: Contains business logic.
  - `Domain`: Core domain entities.
  - `Infrastructure`: Database and external services.
  ```

### **2. Source Code Folder (`/src`)**

This folder holds the actual **source code** of the project, which is further divided into **different layers** that follow the **Clean Architecture** pattern.

#### 2.1 **WebApi (`/src/WebApi`)**
This folder contains the **API** project that handles HTTP requests, API controllers, views (if MVC), and static files.

- **WebApi.csproj**:  
  This is the **project file** for the Web API. It includes references to the necessary packages and dependencies for the web application.

- **Controllers**:  
  This folder contains the **API controllers**. Controllers manage HTTP requests and return responses. In Clean Architecture, controllers should only be responsible for **handling input and output**; they don’t directly contain business logic.

  Example:
  ```csharp
  [ApiController]
  [Route("api/[controller]")]
  public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
  {
      private readonly IProductService _productService;
      
      public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
      {
          _productService = productService;
      }

      [HttpGet]
      public async Task<IActionResult> GetAllProducts()
      {
          var products = await _productService.GetProductsAsync();
          return Ok(products);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Views**:  
  This folder would be used **if you are using MVC**. It contains the HTML, Razor, or Blazor views for the front end of your application.

- **wwwroot**:  
  Contains **static files** like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly to clients.

- **Program.cs**:  
  This is the entry point for your application. In ASP.NET Core, `Program.cs` configures services, middleware, and the HTTP request pipeline.
  Example:
  ```csharp
  public class Program
  {
      public static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
      }

      public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
          Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
              .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
              {
                  webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
              });
  }
  ```

#### 2.2 **Application Layer (`/src/Application`)**

This layer contains **business logic** (use cases, services) and **data transfer objects (DTOs)**.

- **Application.csproj**:  
  The project file for the Application layer.

- **Services**:  
  Contains business logic and services that implement use cases. This is where your application’s **core functionality** resides, independent of the web framework.
  
  Example:
  ```csharp
  public class ProductService : IProductService
  {
      private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;

      public ProductService(IProductRepository productRepository)
      {
          _productRepository = productRepository;
      }

      public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProductsAsync()
      {
          return await _productRepository.GetAllProductsAsync();
      }
  }
  ```

- **Interfaces**:  
  Interfaces for the services. These are used for **dependency injection** and to abstract away the implementation details. This is part of **Inversion of Control (IoC)** in Clean Architecture.

- **DTOs**:  
  **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** are objects used to transfer data across layers. They are used to **reduce dependency** between the layers and ensure that each layer only knows about the necessary properties.

---

#### 2.3 **Domain Layer (`/src/Domain`)**

The Domain layer contains the **core domain entities**, which represent the business model. It should be independent of any other layer.

- **Domain.csproj**:  
  The project file for the Domain layer.

- **Entities**:  
  Contains **business entities** (like Product, Customer, etc.). These represent the data and business logic that is not tied to any framework.
  
  Example:
  ```csharp
  public class Product
  {
      public int Id { get; set; }
      public string Name { get; set; }
      public decimal Price { get; set; }
  }
  ```

- **Enums**:  
  Contains **enumerations** used across the application (for example, status codes or types of orders).

- **ValueObjects**:  
  Contains **value objects** which are objects that hold attributes but don’t have an identity. Examples could include `Address`, `Money`, etc.

---

#### 2.4 **Infrastructure Layer (`/src/Infrastructure`)**

The Infrastructure layer handles things like **database access** (using Entity Framework Core), **logging**, and **external services**.

- **Infrastructure.csproj**:  
  The project file for the Infrastructure layer.

- **Data**:  
  Contains the **repository classes** and **Entity Framework Core** configurations. It is responsible for managing the database context and handling persistence.

  Example:
  ```csharp
  public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
  {
      public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
  }
  ```

- **Logging**:  
  Contains the **logging setup** for the application. This might be used to configure third-party logging services (like Serilog, NLog, etc.) or ASP.NET Core’s built-in logging.

- **Services**:  
  External services (such as an API integration, email service, or payment gateway) that your application relies on.

---

### **3. Tests Folder (`/tests`)**

This folder contains unit and integration tests for the application. It is highly recommended to have tests for each layer of the application to ensure it works as expected.

- **WebApi.Tests**:  
  Unit tests for the Web API layer (controllers, routes).

- **Application.Tests**:  
  Unit tests for the application’s business logic layer (services, use cases).

- **Domain.Tests**:  
  Unit tests for the domain layer (entities, value objects).

- **Infrastructure.Tests**:  
  Unit tests for the Infrastructure layer (data access, external services).

---

### **4. Additional Folders (Optional)**

- **/build**:  
  Contains **CI/CD scripts** and automation files (like for Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins).

- **/docker**:  
  Contains **Docker-related files**, if you plan to containerize your application.

- **/docs**:  
  Documentation files that explain architecture decisions, setup guides, and additional info.

- **/tools**:  
  Contains any custom tools or scripts for development (e.g., database migrations, code generation).
